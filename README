Our goal is to read large files (Around 400MB) and make inferences about said vehicle. We should also suport inputting prior vehicle information, or user input to target specific areas of interest, for example battery diagnostics. This would work best with a database of unique vehicle IDs, where we can store Analytics about each vehicle and potentially detect problems before they happen!
